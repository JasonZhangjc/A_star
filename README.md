# A* Agorithm for Path Finding in C++

This program is inspired by the program in https://blog.csdn.net/xgf415/article/details/75200047</br>
This is a demo for how to use it.
 
To run the project:
 1. In the "build" directory, directly run$ ./ASTAR.
 2. If you changed the code, you could use "cmake" (https://cmake.org/) to compile the program.
